    <p>The adeptus Mechanicus is the main advocators for technology out of Humanities factions. These individuals have gone the opposite of the astartes and believe that flesh is weak and should be replaced by technology. Member of the Mechanicus will replace their flesh with tech over time vastly extending their lives and making them extremely deadly. With robotics replacing their body they become smarter stronger and faster than the average human only topped physically by the astartes. These members come equipted with the best armaments man has to offer, energy weapons, plasma weapons, and weapons that tear reality itself apart.</p>

    <p>The mechanicus was founded just after the golden age of man along side the astartes. These fanatics believed it was mans emotions and illogical behavior that nearly broke humanity and swore they would replace these inferior parts of themselves with the logical machines. Many of the oldest members "the magos" have replaced ever part of themselves except the brain and have improved the brain to the point of being ageless, some even say the oldest are several thousand years old.</p>
